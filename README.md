# Aether-3D
Aether 3D is an interactive, magical web application that lets you control 3D particle systems using only your hand gestures. Built with Three.js and MediaPipe, it turns your webcam into a magical interface where you can conjure shapes, control their rotation, and even use AI and voice commands to create new forms.
